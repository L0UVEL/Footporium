Footporium Database Entity Relationships

1. Users and Addresses (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: A single User can have multiple Addresses.
   - Foreign Key: `addresses.user_id` references `users.id`.
   - Explanation: This allows a user to store multiple shipping addresses (e.g., home, work), but each address record belongs to only one specific user.

2. Users and Orders (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: A single User can place multiple Orders.
   - Foreign Key: `orders.user_id` references `users.id`.
   - Explanation: This tracks the purchase history of a user. An order must be linked to the user who placed it.

3. Addresses and Orders (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: An Address can be used for multiple Orders.
   - Foreign Key: `orders.address_id` references `addresses.id`.
   - Explanation: When an order is placed, it is linked to a specific shipping address. Over time, the same address record can be referenced by many different orders.

4. Orders and Order Items (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: A single Order contains multiple Order Items.
   - Foreign Key: `order_items.order_id` references `orders.id`.
   - Explanation: An order is essentially a "header" (total amount, date, status). The specific details of what was bought are stored in `order_items`. One order can consist of many different products.

5. Products and Order Items (One-to-Many)
   - Relationship: A Product can appear in multiple Order Items (across different orders).
   - Foreign Key: `order_items.product_id` references `products.id`.
   - Explanation: This links the line item back to the product definition (name, description, image). Note that we store the `price` in `order_items` as well, to preserve the price *at the time of purchase* even if the product price changes later.

6. Orders and Payments (One-to-One)
   - Relationship: An Order typically has one Payment record.
   - Foreign Key: `payments.order_id` references `orders.id`.
   - Explanation: This links the financial transaction to the order. While complex systems might allow split payments, for this design, we assume one payment transaction per order.
